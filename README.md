# Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the transverse field Ising model using the stochastic series expansion method

## What this programme is

This programme is am implementation of a quantum Monte Carlo algorithm (QMC) using stochastic series expansion (SSE) developed by Anders Sandvik.
It is intended to simulate transverse-field Ising models (TFIMs) on arbitrary lattices and with arbitrary interactions. The only input this
programme requires are a file containing all bonds in the model and their respective coupling constants (*bonds.txt*) as well as a
configuration file (*setup.txt*) containing details such as the number of sweeps, etc.

## How to run this programme

1. To generate an input file containing all bonds (*bonds.txt*), run
	```python genlattice.py chain {n}```
	to generate a chain of *n* spins with periodic boundary conditions (PBC). To generate
	a simple square lattice with PBC, run
	```python genlattice.py square {nx} {ny}```.
	An output file (*bonds_{lattice}.txt*) will be generated, which you will need to rename to *bonds.txt*
	and put into the same directory as the main programme.
2. Modify *setup.json* as needed. The input parameters are:
	* *eqsweeps*: number of equilibration Monte Carlo (MC) sweeps per spin
	* *bins*: number of bins to average into
	* *avsweeps*: number of averaging MC sweeps per bin per spin
	* *operator_mode*: type of spin operator; either *pauli* (Pauli matrices) or *one-half* (spin-1/2 operators)
3. Compile *qmc.cpp*:
	```g++ qmc.cpp -g -o qmc```
4. Run executable with inline parameters:
	```./qmc {output directoy} {temperature} {transverse field} {longitudinal field}```

## Equilibration issues

At low temperature, he results of this algorithm will depend slightly on the choice of initial (periodic) state ...
